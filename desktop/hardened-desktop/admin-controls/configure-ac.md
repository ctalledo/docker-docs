title: Configure Admin Controls
--- 

>Note
>
>Admin Controls is currently in [Early Access](../../../release-lifecycle.md#early-access-ea) and available to Docker Business customers only. 

This page contains information about how administrators can configure Admin Controls to specify and lock configuration parameters to create a standardized Docker Desktop environment across the organization.

Admin Controls is designed specifically for organizations who donâ€™t give developers root access to their machines.

## Prerequisite

You need to [configure a registry.json to enforce sign-in](../../../docker-hub/configure-sign-in.md). For this configuration to take effect, Docker Desktop users must authenticate to your organization. 

## Step one: Place the `admin-settings.json` file in the correct location

Place the `admin-settings.json` file on your developers' machines in the following locations:

- Mac: /Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker/admin-settings.json
- Windows: /ProgramData/DockerDesktop/admin-settings.json
- Linux - /usr/share/docker-desktop/admin-settings.json 

By placing this file in the above protected directories, end users are unable to modify it.

>Note
>
> It is assumed that you have the ability to push the `admin-settings.json` settings file to the locations specified above through a device management software such as [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/lp/en-gb/apple-mobile-device-management-mdm-jamf-shared/?attr=google_ads-brand-search-shared&gclid=CjwKCAjw1ICZBhAzEiwAFfvFhEXjayUAi8FHHv1JJitFPb47C_q_RCySTmF86twF1qJc_6GST-YDmhoCuJsQAvD_BwE).

## Step two: Add the key value pairs for the admin controls you want to lock in

>Note
>
>Some of the configuration parameters only apply to Windows. This is highlighted in the table below.

The `admin-settings.json` file requires a nested list of configuration parameters, each of which must contain the  `locked` parameter. 
If set to `true`, users are not able to edit this setting from Docker Desktop or the CLI. 
If set to `false`, users can change this setting from Docker Desktop or the CLI by directly editing the `settings.json` file. If this setting is omitted, the default value is `false`.

The following `admin-settings.json` code and table provides the required syntax and descriptions for parameters and values:

```json
{
  "configurationFileVersion": 2,
  "exposeDockerAPIOnTCP2375": {
    "locked": true,
    "value": false
  },
  "proxy": {
    "locked": false,
    "mode": "system",
    "server": "myproxy.com",
    "port":3129,
    "exclude": ["foo.com", "bar.com"]
  },
  "enhancedContainerIsolation": {
    "locked": false,
    "value": false
  },
  "useWindowsContainers": {
      "locked": false,
      "value": false
  },
  "linuxVM": {
    "wslEngineEnabled": {
      "locked": false,
      "value": false
    },
    "dockerDaemonOptions": {
      "locked": false,
      "value":"<json string>"
    },
    "vpnkitCIDR": {
      "locked": false,
      "value":"192.168.65.0/24"
    }
  },
  "windowsContainers": {
    "dockerDaemonOptions": {
      "locked": false,
      "value":"<json string>"
    }
  },
  "disableUpdate": {
    "locked": false,
    "value": false
  },
  "analyticsEnabled": {
    "locked": false,
    "value": true
  },
}
```

| Parameter                        | Description                      |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| `configurationFileVersion`        | Specifies the version of the configuration file format.    |
| `exposeDockerAPIOnTCP2375` |<span class="badge badge-info">Windows only</span> Exposes the Docker API on a specified port. If `value` is set to true, the Docker API is exposed on port 2375. Note: This is unauthenticated and should only be enabled if protected by suitable firewall rules.|
| `proxy` | It is used for `http` and `https`.  If the port is custom, specify it in the property. |
| `enhancedContainerIsolation`  | If `value` is set to true, Docker Desktop prevents user containers from running as root and from being able to mount sensitive Docker Desktop configuration directories from the Docker Desktop VM. |
|`useWindowsContainers` | <span class="badge badge-info">Windows only</span> If `value` is set to true, it switches Docker Desktop to toggle the Docker CLI to talk to the Windows daemon, enabling Windows containers. If false, switches Docker Desktop to toggle the Docker CLI to talk to the Linux daemon, enabling Linux containers. This overrides anything that may have been set at installation using the `--no-windows-containers` flag.|
| `linuxVM` | Parameters and settings related to Linux VM options - grouped together here for convenience. |
|`wslEngineEnabled`  |<span class="badge badge-info">Windows only</span> If `value` is set to true, Docker Desktop uses the WSL 2 based engine. This overrides anything that may have been set at installation using the `--backend=<backend name>` flag. It is also incompatible with Enhanced Container Isolation. See [Known issues](faq.md) for more information.|
| `dockerDaemonOptions`|If `value` is set to true, it overrides the options in the Linux daemon config file. See the [Docker Engine reference](../../../engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file). |
| `vpnkitCIDR` |Overrides the network range used for vpnkit DHCP/DNS for `*.docker.internal`  |
| (End of `linuxVM` section.)       |                                   |
| `windowsContainers` | Parameters and settings related to `windowsContainers` options - grouped together here for convenience.                  |
| `dockerDaemonOptions` | Overrides the options in the linux daemon config file. See the [Docker Engine reference](../../../engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file).|
| (End of `windowsContainers` section.)    |                                   |
|`disableUpdate`|If `value` is set to true, checking for and notifications about Docker Desktop updates is disabled.|
|`analyticsEnabled`|If `value` is set to false, Docker Desktop does not send usage statistics to Docker. |

## Step three: Re-launch and re-authenticate 
Once you have created and configured `admin-settings.json`, developers need to quit Docker Desktop through the Whale menu, and then relaunch Docker Desktop and sign in to receive the changed settings.

Docker doesn't automatically mandate that developers re-launch and re-authenticate once a change has been made so as not to disrupt your developers workflow. 

## Example

The following image displays an example `admin-settings.json` file:

![admin-settings.json](../../images/admin-settings.PNG){:width="500px"}

In Docker Desktop, developers see the relevant settings grayed out and the message **This is locked by your admin**.
