Hardened Desktop is a new security model for Docker Desktop. It is part of Docker's ongoing effort to increase Docker Desktop security without impacting the developer experience.

The Hardened Desktop security model provides Enterprise admins with a simple and powerful way to increase the security of their containerised development and moves the ownership boundary for containers to the organization, meaning that any security controls admins set cannot be altered by the user.

Hardened Desktop currently includes:
- Enhanced Container Isolation. This is a setting that helps admins to instantly enhance security by preventing containers from running as root in Docker Desktopâ€™s Linux VM.
- Admin Controls. which helps Enterprise admins to confidently manage and control usage of Docker Desktop.
- Registry Access Management. Working in tandem with Admin Controls and Enhanced Container Isolation 

Docker will be adding more security enhancements to the Hardened Desktop security model over the coming months.
